# Samosa Selector

Submitted by: **Kevin Tusiime**

This web app is a Samosa Selector game inspired by the incremental game, Cookie Clicker. The goal is to produce as many samosas as possible by clicking on the Big Samosa. As you accumulate samosas, you can unlock upgrades to increase your samosa production rate.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Gameplay

The game starts with zero samosas. Clicking the Big Samosa produces one samosa per click. As you accumulate samosas, you can purchase upgrades to increase the number of samosas per click:

- **Double Stuffed**: Doubles the samosas per click (Cost: 10 samosas)
- **Party Pack**: Increases samosas per click by 5x (Cost: 100 samosas)
- **Full Feast**: Increases samosas per click by 10x (Cost: 1000 samosas)

The game continues indefinitely, allowing you to accumulate a large number of samosas!

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Clicking the large samosa increases the samosa count by 1.
- [x] Three available upgrades - Double Stuffed, Party Pack, and Full Feast - increase the number of samosas per click at certain point thresholds.

## Optional Features

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Purchasing an upgrade reduces the total samosas count.
- [x] Added a "pulse" effect to the samosa that shrinks when clicked and grows when hovered over.

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of the implemented features:
